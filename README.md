1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the project directory in your terminal.
3. Run the following command to install the dependencies:

   npm install
Dependencies
This project uses the following dependencies:

React - JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
React DOM - Provides DOM-specific methods that can be used at the top level of a web app to enable React components to be rendered into the DOM.
React Router DOM - DOM bindings for React Router, which is a popular routing library for React applications.
@mui/material - React UI framework for building user interfaces.
Dev Dependencies:

@emotion/react - Library for writing CSS styles with JavaScript.
@emotion/styled - Utility for styling React components with Emotion.
@testing-library/jest-dom - Custom Jest matchers to test DOM elements.
@testing-library/react - Testing utilities for React.
@testing-library/user-event - Fire events as if a real user is interacting with your app.
Usage
Once the dependencies are installed, you can run the project using the following command:

bash
npm start
This will start the development server and open the application in your default web browser.
# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
